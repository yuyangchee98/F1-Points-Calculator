Project scope

I am creating a F1 related application to calculate total points at the end of the year with these key features:
    - Automatic calculation of driver points and championship standings simply by moving a driver card around on the screen.
    - The screen is a table that shows each race (including sprint races). 
    - Drag-and-drop interface for modifying race results.
    - Already happened races are set in stone. Please allow me to input the data in my js file. 
    - Real-time recalculation of points and standings based on user changes.
